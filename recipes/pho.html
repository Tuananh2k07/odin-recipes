    <p>Craving warm, comforting pho? Well, then let us introduce you to the tastiest pho recipe on the internet. The key to this authentic Vietnamese soup is the flavorful broth that simmers for at least six hours before serving over rice noodles.</p>

    <h2>What is Pho?</h2>
    <p>Pho is a soup consisting of bone broth, rice noodles, thinly-sliced meat (in this recipe, it's beef), and fresh garnishes.</p>
    
    <h2>Where is Pho From?</h2>
    <p>As with many foods, the origins of pho are unknown. It is believed to have been created in northern Vietnam in the early 20th century. It gained popularity in many countries after the Vietnam War.</p>
    
    <h2>Pho Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Because you're making this authentic Vietnamese soup completely from scratch, the ingredient list is a little hefty. Here's what you'll need:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><h4>Beef Soup Bones</h4>
    <p>Use the shank and knee to make the homemade bone broth.</p></li>
    <li><h4>Rice Noodles</h4>
    <p>You should be able to find dry rice noodles at most grocery stores, either in the international aisle or another pantry aisle.</p></li>
    <li><h4>Beef</h4>
    <p>This recipe calls for beef top sirloin. Make sure it's thinly sliced so the hot broth can cook it.</p></li>
    <li><h4>Fish Sauce</h4>
    <p>Fish sauce will give the pho a hint of salty, fishy flavor.</p></li>
    <li><h4>Onion</h4>
    <p>Roast the onions for an extra depth of flavor.</p></li>
    <li><h4>Spices and Seasonings</h4>
    <p>This recipe calls for ginger, star anise, and salt.</p></li>
    <li><h4>Garnishes</h4>
    <p>Garnish your pho with cilantro, green onion, Thai basil, lime, hoisin sauce, sriracha, or anything else you like.</p></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How to Make Pho</h2>
    <p>Pho is quite simple to make, it's just a little time consuming. You'll find the full, detailed recipe below — but here's what you can expect when making this pho:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><h4>Roast Bones and Onion</h4>
    <p>Roast the beef bones and onions until the bones are browned and the onions are soft.</p></li>
    <li><h4>Make the Broth</h4>
    <p>Combine roasted beef bones, roasted onions, ginger, salt, star anise, fish sauce, and water in a large stockpot. Allow to simmer for 6 to 10 hours. Then, strain the broth into a new saucepan.</p></li>
    <li><h4>Soak the Rice Noodles</h4>
    <p>Allow dry rice noodles to soak for 1 hour. While they're soaking, bring broth to a simmer.</p></li>
    <li><h4>Cook the Rice Noodles</h4>
    <p>Cook the rice noodles in boiling water. Drain and add noodles to a bowl topped with sirloin, cilantro, green onion, and broth. Garnish with your desired toppings.</p></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How to Store Pho</h2>
    <p>Store broth and rice noodles separately in their own airtight containers in the fridge. They will stay fresh for up to four days. When you're ready to eat, reheat the broth on the stove and rice noodles in the microwave. Combine and enjoy.</p>
    
    <h2>How to Freeze Pho</h2>
    <p> You can only freeze the pho broth, not the rice noodles. Store completely cooled broth in airtight containers or zip-top freezer bags (frozen flat) in the freezer for up to three months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight and reheat on the stove.</p>
